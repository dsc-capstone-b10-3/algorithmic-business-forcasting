# Forecasting Regional Aggregate Establishment Birth-Death Values: Using Algorithmic Modeling

 ![error](/img/docusaurus-social-card.jpg)

## Introduction

This is a project created in partnership with The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) under UC San Diego’s Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute undergraduate mentorship program. The work was conducated as our final capstone project, and is meant to serve as a proof-of-concept for the use of "algorithmic" machine learning to augment and improve SANDAG's current forecasting methodologies.

## Why Establishment Birth-Death Forecasting?

Establishment birth and death data are highly significant for understanding the job market and business cycles. Birth data provide a measure of entrepreneurial activities and gauge new entries and reallocation of resources towards growing areas. Similarly, business death data measure failing enterprises and identify sectors from which resources are being shifted away. Accurate data on establishment birth and death values are valuable for local government planning organizations, providing significant insight into the state of national/regional entrepreneurship, and informing local planning and policy-making.

As a local transportation planning organization, The San Diego Association of Governments(SANDAG), whom we collaborated with in partnership on this project, utilizes such forecasts to identify areas of future growth, correlated with increased transportation demand, to inform future transportation development.

Effective and accurate forecasts allow government organizations to, in a way, "peek into the future", and make better plannning decisions today. For example, knowing X could help ...

## The Current State of Regional Forecasting

Despite the recent rise in popularity of Machine Learning and AI with products such as ChatGPT and Tesla's Self-Driving Assistance Systems, regional forecasting techniques still rely heavily on comparatively simple models built upon the backs of rigid statistical theory. The problem, however, is that the simplifying assumptions these models are built upon have mostly fallen apart with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, leading current forecasts to vastly overpredict business growth despite the recessionary period. 

## What Did We Do?

Seeing this, we wondered if "algorithmic" machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, which most current bleeding-edge AI products are built on, could address the overprediction we are currently experience by learning from the past and forecasting recessionary years before they happen. While doing this, we focused on data from the San Diego County, to ensure that our results are easily applicable to SANDAG's work.

Here is a sneak peek of our final forecasts...

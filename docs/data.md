# Data

## What Data We Wanted

In a perfect world, to forecasts establishment birth-death values at a regional level, we would have access to establishment birth-death data by month for an expansive range of years, that is further broken down by some sort of small geographical area, such as census blocks. However, for security reasons, data at most small geographica areas are generally restricted for use by government organizations, and not available to the general public.

## What Data We Used

Given the aforementioned data limitations, we sourced data on the count of establishments
broken down by year and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA). While birth-death data is available by month through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’s Current Employment Statistics
program and by county or state from the U.S. Census’ Business Dynamics Statistics program, we sought to look for smaller geographic areas, to stay within the San Diego County.
To this end, ZCTAs were the smallest level of geographical area for which data we could
get our hands on. However, since birth-death data were not available by ZCTA we substituted it by using establishment counts, which is roughly equivalent to the previous year’s
establishment count plus total births minus total deaths.

This data on establishment counts by ZTCA can be found in the U.S. Census Bureau’s ZIP
Code Business Patterns Totals datasets, collected as part of the County Business Patterns
(CBP) program. As ZBP data was only available up to 2021 at the time of our project, we
used data from 2012 to 2021. While ZBP records back until 1984 exist, a lack of auxiliary
data, explained below, restricted our data to 2012 and after.

In exploring potential explanatory variables, we referenced prior analyses on regional variation in business births and deaths (Reynolds, Miller and Maki 1995). Based on their work
we collected and processed data representing the processes they found to have “major” or
“strong” explanatory power. We sourced this data from the following socio-demographic
and economic datasets from the U.S. Census:

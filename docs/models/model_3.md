# Random Forest Regressor

## How It Works

Random forest models (Breiman 2001) are a popular “catch-all” type of model and a key
representative of “Algorithmic Modeling”(Breiman 2003).

## Why We Think It's Good

Because random forest models
assume little to nothing about the data, and iteratively split the data to make predictions, it
often performs well on all sorts of datasets, making it a potential candidate for our problem.
